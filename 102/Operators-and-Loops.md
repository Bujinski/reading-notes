# Operators and Loops

## Q: What is an `expression` in JavaScript?

is when you use an operator `(such as + or -)` that when calculated will result in a value.

> Ex: x = 7 + 4;

## Q: Why would we use a loop in our code?

When you want to repeat something over and over until you get a desired result, you would use a loop.

> Ex: You want to count to 10 and stop when you’ve reached that number. You would use a loop.

## Q: When does a `for` loop stop executing?

When it reaches the stopping point the programmer has put in place. If there isn’t anything in place, this results in an infinite loop. It’s like a song that doesn’t end. It just goes on and on.

## Q: How many times will a `while` loop execute?

Until it is coded to stop. If it isn’t coded, it ain’t stopping! Depends on the condition specified in the loop.
