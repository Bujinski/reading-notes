# Structure Web Pages with HTML

## Q: What is HTML and why do we use it?

HTML or HyperText Markup Language is a markup language. As Wikipedia states, a markup language is a text-encoding system consisting of a set of symbols inserted in a text document to control its structure, formatting, or the relationship between its parts.

- This code is used to structure a website. For a basic layout (without style or sizing) you can use this to make the beginnings of a website.

- Think of it as the bare bones or basic structure of house. You have a foundation, walls, and a roof. You will still need to paint the house, furnish it, and include utilities. But at least you got the house started! Thatâ€™s what HTML accomplishes.

- Adding in CSS and Javascript will refine, furnish, and bring functionality to your home, but you need to start with a basic structure to then build off of.

## Q: What are the 3 main parts of an HTML element?

The entirety of parts is called an element. The 3 main parts of an element is an opening tag, the content within, and a closing tag.

> An example of this is <h1>Content</h1>.

- Note: there are self-closing tags which will not include a closing tag, only an opening tag and content.

## Q: What is it called when you give an element extra information?

> Attribute

- This provides extra information that will not be seen on the website. It allows us to give an identifier that can be used to adjust or provide information to an element.

- Attributes that set a value will include:

1) A space between the element/previous attribute.
2) The attribute will be followed by an equal sign.
3) The value will be wrapped in quotation marks. Quotations are not always required. However, it is best practices to include them.

## Q: What is a semantic element?

> Semantics = Meaning 

- Think about the purpose of this code, and what role it plays. Instead of thinking about the appearance, when talking about semantics, we are thinking about why it is there and what its effect is.
