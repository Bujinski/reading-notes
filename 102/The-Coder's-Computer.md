# The Coderâ€™s Computer

## Q: What are four important features to look for in a text editor?

1) **Syntax Highlighting**:

* A good text editor should offer syntax highlighting, which means it colorizes different parts of your code according to their roles (keywords, variables, comments, etc.).

3) **Auto-Completion**:

* Auto-completion, or code suggestion, is a feature that predicts and suggests code snippets as you type.

6) **Customizability**:

* A text editor that allows you to customize its appearance, keyboard shortcuts, and even supports extensions or plugins can greatly enhance your workflow.

8) **Version Control Integration**:

* Integration with version control systems like Git can be crucial, especially for software development. The ability to commit, pull, push, and manage branches directly from your text editor can streamline collaborative coding and version management.

## Q: What do the following commands do?

* pwd

> Print Working Directory

* ls

> list

* cd 

> Change Directory

* mkdir

> Make Directory

* touch

> Create File

## Q: Can you explain what is happening in the following scenario if these commands and arguments are entered into the command line? (Arguments are extra instructions given to a command.)

1) cd projects

> This is changing the directory (cd) to the projects folder.

2) mkdir new-project

> This is making (mkdir) a new directory that is named new-project.

3) touch new-project/newfile.md

> This is making (touch) a new file (newfile.md) in the folder new-project.

> This will go to that directory (new-project) and create the new file (newfile.md).

4) cd ..

> This is changing directories by going back to the previous folder.

> Changes with x1 . stays in the same directory, x2 .. goes back one, etc.

5) ls projects/new-project

> This is listing (ls) everything in the folder (new-project) by moving/changing directories through the path projects -> new-project.
