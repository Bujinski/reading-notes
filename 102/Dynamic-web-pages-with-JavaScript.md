## Q: What are variables in JavaScript?

JavaScript is variables that are used to store and manage data values. They act as named containers that hold different types of information, such as numbers, strings, objects, or functions. Variables allow us to manipulate and work with data in our programs.

## Q: What does it mean to declare a variable?

Declaring variables is the action of storing (assigning) the specific value to the variable.

- For example: x = 5

> x is the variable and 5 is the value stored within it.

- Variables can be overwritten.

- **var** was previously used to declare a variable.

- **let** and **const** are now used.

> When to Use var, let, or const?

1. Always declare variables

2. Always use const if the value should not be changed

3. Always use const if the type should not be changed (Arrays and Objects)

4. Only use let if you can't use const

5. Only use var if you MUST support old browsers.

## Q: What is an “assignment” operator, and what does it do?

It is noted (syntax) as an **=**but doesn’t operate as such. It acts as the bridge between an empty variable and the value being assigned to it, hence assignment operator. It’s functionailty is to take the value and store it in a variable.

> - It is best practice to always assign your variable.

> - What if the variable doesn’t have a value yet?

> - It can be noted as **""** in lieu of a value.

## Q: What is information received from the user called?

> Input.

> - For example, the **prompt()** function will ask the user for information, that is referred to as input. The user can then enter a value and this can be saved to use for other purposes.
