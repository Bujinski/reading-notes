# The Coderâ€™s Computer

## What are four important features to look for in a text editor?

1) **Syntax Highlighting**:

* A good text editor should offer syntax highlighting, which means it colorizes different parts of your code according to their roles (keywords, variables, comments, etc.).

3) **Auto-Completion**:

* Auto-completion, or code suggestion, is a feature that predicts and suggests code snippets as you type.

6) **Customizability**:

* A text editor that allows you to customize its appearance, keyboard shortcuts, and even supports extensions or plugins can greatly enhance your workflow.

8) **Version Control Integration**:

* Integration with version control systems like Git can be crucial, especially for software development. The ability to commit, pull, push, and manage branches directly from your text editor can streamline collaborative coding and version management.
