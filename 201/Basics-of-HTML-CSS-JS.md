# Basics of HTML, CSS & JS

## Q 1. Why is it important to use semantic elements in our HTML?

Using semantic elements in HTML is important for clarity, accessibility, SEO, consistency, and future compatibility. Semantic tags provide a clear structure, improve accessibility for users with disabilities, enhance search engine optimization, maintain code consistency, and ensure adaptability to future web standards.

## Q 2. How many levels of headings are there in HTML?

There are six levels of headings in HTML, from `<h1>` (highest level) to `<h6>` (lowest level).

## Q 3. What are some uses for the `sup` and `sub` elements?

The `<sup>` element is used to define superscript text, often for exponents or footnotes. The `<sub>` element is used for subscript text, such as chemical formulas or mathematical notations.

## Q 4. When using the `abbr` element, what attribute must be added to provide the full expansion of the term?

The `title` attribute must be added to the `abbr` element to provide the full expansion or explanation of the term.

# Learn CSS

## Q 1. What are ways we can apply CSS to our HTML?

We can apply CSS to HTML using inline styles, internal styles (within < style > tags in the < head >), or external styles (linking to a separate CSS file using the < link > tag).

## Q 2. Why should we avoid using inline styles?

Because they mix HTML content with presentation, making the code less maintainable, harder to read, and reducing the reusability of styles. Separating HTML and CSS improves code organization and allows for easier global styling.

## Q 3. Review the block of code below and answer the following questions:

> **1. What is representing the selector?**

- Selector: `h2`

> **2. Which components are the CSS declarations?**

- CSS Declarations: color: black; and padding: 5px;

> **3. Which components are considered properties?**

- Properties: color and padding.

# Learn JS

## Q 1. What data type is a sequence of text enclosed in single quote marks?

A sequence of text enclosed in single quote marks is of the data type "string." Strings are used to represent textual data in many programming languages, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, and others.

## Q 2. List 4 types of JavaScript operators.

> Arithmetic Operators: **Example: +, -, *, /, %**

> Comparison Operators: **Example: ==, ===, !=, !==, >, <, >=, <=**

> Logical Operators: **Example: && (AND), || (OR), ! (NOT)**

> Assignment Operators: **Example: =, +=, -=, *=, /=**

## Q 3. Describe a real world Problem you could solve with a Function.

A real-world problem that can be solved with a function is calculating the tip amount for a restaurant bill based on a specified percentage.

## Q 1. An if statement checks a __ and if it evaluates to ___, then the code block will execute.

An `if` statement checks a condition, and if it evaluates to true, then the code block will execute.

## Q 2. What is the use of an `else if`?

The `else if` statement allows you to check multiple conditions sequentially after an initial `if` statement. If the initial condition is false, it provides an alternative condition to evaluate.

## Q 3. List 3 different types of comparison operators.

**Equal (==)**: Checks if two values are equal, regardless of their data types.

**Not Equal (!=)**: Checks if two values are not equal, regardless of their data types.

**Strict Equal (===)**: Checks if two values are equal, including both value and data type.

## Q 4. What is the difference between the logical operator `&&` and `||`?

- `&&` is true only when both conditions are true.
- `||` is true when at least one condition is true.
